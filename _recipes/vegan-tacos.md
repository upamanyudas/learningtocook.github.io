This recipe was gifted to me by a friend. Knowing my inability to deal with things like `salt to taste` ðŸ˜‚ she tried her best to measure the seasonings. I tried it for the first time while making this video. Although I was not sure at the beginning (it being vegan and all), it turned our really yummy! Try it, you won't be dissapointed.
