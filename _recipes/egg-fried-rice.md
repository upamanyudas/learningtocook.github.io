It amazes me sometimes at how versatile this fried rice is. It was a staple in my houshold. This can be had with pretty much any meat or veg gravies. From tandoori, to mughlai to chinese. This recipe is also the first one I took down from my mother. I have made this more times than any other. Make it, with or without the egg. It'll add lots of veggies to the plate at the same time tasting awesome!
