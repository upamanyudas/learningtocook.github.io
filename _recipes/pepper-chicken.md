This is again a recreating a recipe from Ma. She learnt it from one of our family friends - whose house we used visit often in Malvan. This is super easy to make but very delicious at the same time. The most time is taken up when you wait for the chicken to cook, and oil to separate. I've used chicken thighs, them being easier to tenderise. Enjoy this on a game night or when you're entertaining.
