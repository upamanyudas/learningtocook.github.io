Oh! writing this and cooking this recipe brings back so many memories. This was a typical sunday lunch for us. The fragrances of my mother or grandmother cooking this on a hot sunday afternoon, wafted through the neighborhood like sweet nectar. Most sundays a scrumptious chicken lunch was followed by a joyous siesta! Enter the blisland and cook this already!
