This is my take on the classic street food from Kolkata - the Moglai Porota. A quintessential part of Kolkata’s street food scene, a deep fried pastry filled with minced mutton, beaten eggs and a number of other spices and served with Dry Gravy Potato and salad. I’ve tried to make this process simpler by cutting out the pastry making and replacing it with store bought tortillas. The result has been comparable.
