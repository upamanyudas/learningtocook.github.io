I love cooking minced chicken. Why you ask? I've figured that it takes far less effort for it to become tender. Also has a very low error margin for making mistakes. This is such a recipe quick and easy to make for weekday lunch-boxes. I generally make this in the evening and pack it up for the next day. The mix of tang from the lemon, aroma from coriander and umami from the soy sauce combine to make a yummy dish.
