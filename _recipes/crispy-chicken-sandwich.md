This Crispy Chicken Sandwich is inspired from a variety of different techniques my mother used growing up. A simple and easy meal that is perfect for lunch or dinner. The super tasty romesco sauce holds the sandwich together. This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever made. And best of all, you can make and store the romesco sauce - to be used as a dip on a charcuterie board.
